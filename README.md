# Bitcoin-price-prediction

The goal for this project is to show how a trained model can predict the price of a cryptocurrency using Bitcoin if we give the right amount of data and computational power 
using Long Short Term Memory. This was my project in "ECE 542: Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course at NC State University.
